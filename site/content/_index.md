    Product  Reviews

    Reviews for the Oaskys Memory Foam Mattress Pad have so far been very positive. Several of the most positive comments have come from people who have undergone spinal surgery. These reviewers reported a difference in their sleep patterns right away, thank this mattress pad. It takes some time to set up and put into place, but this was not a problem for these people, even considering the surgery. People with sciatica and hip problems also expressed that this mattress pad provides relief, causing them actually to look forward to sleeping at night.

    According to these reviews, people who were not able to sleep through the night no longer have that problem. Oaskys technology also received rave reviews. Several people stated that they are able to stay cooler in bed a night on this mattress pad.

    Some of the worst reviews have the same complaint. They state that this mattress does not keep them cool at night; it actually makes them hotter. This is a very common theme that runs through to some of the positive comments as well. At least one reviewer chose to remove the memory foam, which resulted in a cooler night's sleep.


    Setting this pas up can be a bit confusing. It needs to be aired to remove the chemical smell that is sealed into it when packaged for shipment. Once out of the package, do not try to stretch it out to fit it into the bed. Lay it out on the bed and leave it for a few hours. It will gradually stretch itself out on its own. This is a highly recommended mattress pad. There is some question as to the cooling technology's effectiveness, but the memory foam padding is fantastic. This pad might fall short on its claim of keeping you cool at night, but it definitely provides the pain relief that it promises.

    Serta Memory Foam Mattress Topper 

    The thick Serta 4-Inch Memory Foam Topper gives much comfort and support. Many people suffer from sleep problems.

    Product Reviews

    The Serta 4-Inch Memory Foam Topper is very well regarded. Sleeping on it is described to be like sleeping on a cloud. According to the reviewers, the pain relief that this topper offers is real. There are many reports of people waking up feeling much better than ever before. People who tossed and turned at night can now sleep still and comfortably.

    There is no problem with the topper fitting the bed, either. The topper can wrap around either the mattress or the mattress and the box spring together. Fitted sheets also fit well on the bed even with this mattress topper. There is an initial odor when the package it comes in is opened. This odor can be disconcerting. But if the topper is allowed to air out for a few hours, the smell will go away. This is not at all unusual for memory foam pads and toppers.

    Many of the negative reviews took issue with the marketing of this product. They felt they were deceived into believing that this topper had 4 inches of memory foam. Instead, it has 2 inches of memory foam and two inches of a soft pillow topper. This fact really upset most of the negative commenters who were expecting more memory foam for the price.

    This is a highly recommended mattress topper. The Serta 4-Inch Memory Foam Topper actually only has two inches of memory foam that are supplemented with 2 inches of a soft pillow topper for added comfort. The end result is a soft mattress with enough added support to relieve body pain in many customers. There is an initial odor with this product that will dissipate if allowed to air out. It should also be allowed to expand for hours after unpacking before putting it on the bed. Forcing it into shape simply will not work.

    Serta Gel-Memory Foam Mattress Topper (2.5″)

    Instead of buying a new expensive mattress, the Serta 2.5-Inch Gel-Memory Foam Mattress Topper can turn your existing mattress into a bed of luxury. The memory foam is fortified with gel beads for the best in coziness and pressure point pain relief. This topper brings together the traditional comfort of memory foam with added support, where it is needed the most.

    Many people suffer from sleep problems that greatly affect their performance for the rest of the day. Getting proper sleep has many health benefits. Memory foam mattresses are made to alleviate pain in people who would otherwise have severe problems falling asleep at night. 

    Product Features

    This queen-sized mattress topper is covered in 100% premium cotton from Egypt. The cover is removable and washable. Made from memory foam infused with gel beads designed to redistribute your body heat, so you stay cooler. The foam and the gel beads work together to eliminate turning and tossing. This results in falling asleep more quickly, sleeping more deeply, and waking up ready to take on the day.

    Dimensions are 80 x 60 x 2.5 inches.

    Product Reviews

    This mattress topper has been very well received. So much, so that negative ratings are almost non-existent. That is not to say that this mattress topper is without complaints. There are actually a few people who have reported that they actually now feel worse instead of better. For some reason, the memory foam design aggravated pain rather than relieving it. One reviewer even stated that it caused back pain for someone who had not suffered from it before using this topper.

    The number of these negative comments is very small compared to the positive comments. One thing that both groups agree on is the gel beads. If, for some reason, the beads come out of the topper, they have a tendency to go all over the place.

    The positive reviews reveal a topper that really works. A large number of people are reporting that this product helps them to get a more comfortable sleep. There is some disagreement among the positive comments on how well the beads work in dissipating body heat. But there is little argument over the fact that it helps people who are suffering from pain to get a more blissful rest. It also doesn't seem to have the same strong odor that other memory foam products are notorious for.

    Based on the strength and number of positive ratings, this product is highly recommended. The Serta 2.5-Inch Gel-Memory Foam Mattress Topper is a great help to people who need additional support and comfort while sleeping. Pain sufferers are experiencing a much deeper sleep than they remember. They are also waking up in the morning feeling fresh and alert. Many people are not able to take advantage of the rejuvenating effect of sleep due to body pain. This mattress topper is reported to help alleviate the kind of pain that keeps people awake at night, allowing them to recharge their batteries with some good sleep.

    Sleep Innovations Dual Layer Mattress Topper

    The Sleep Innovations 4″ Dual Layer Mattress Topper provides 4 inches of pure comfort. This is a queen-sized topper that is broken down into two levels. The first level is made from 2 inches of microfibers that are usually used in pillows. The second level uses 2 inches of polyurethane memory foam, boasting a 3-pound density. A combination of these two materials ensures proper rest and maximum comfort.

    Product Reviews

    Forty-two customers reviewed the Sleep Innovations 4″ Dual Layer Mattress Topper. Overall the product got some pretty good reviews. Many people liked the fact that it added extra comfort for a mattress that was too hard. One user made a great comment and said that this product or any foam topper would not help a mattress that has lost its support. The one thing that you will notice about the product when you first receive it is how heavy it feels. If your mattress is hard and uncomfortable, this topper will add a comfort layer that will help increase the quality of sleep.

    One reviewer had said that they had used a Sleep Innovations mattress for 7 yrs but noticed that it started sinking a bit. When they saw this product, they immediately bought it because it used the same material which had properly served them for the last seven years. This user was not disappointed when they had tried it on top of their old mattress. It helped to add to the support lost on their mattress. The user mentioned that the mattress looked new again, but more importantly, they were able to resume a good night's rest.

    Many people liked the fact that it does not feel hot. Sometimes when you use a foam topper, air does not circulate properly, and it gets a little hot, which makes you sweat a lot. With this model, this doesn't happen. It has a good mix of foam and fibers. As advertised, the foam will hug your body's contours and provide it with the support that many people look for in a mattress.
